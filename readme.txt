The User Plugin lets you connect user through pages, widgets and menus, and redirect them to posts, pages or URLs.

== Description ==

**The User Plugin** - The best way to connect your users

** USER LOGIN AND REGISTRATION **
>The User Plugin* has been designed to make user login and/or registration to your website easier. Instead of using WordPress's login form, you can allow them to connect using a specific page, a widget or even a menu.

** USER REDIRECTION **
>The User Plugin* enables you to redirect users to specific pages or URLs on login and logout actions. You can add general rules, role based rules and even user based rules.

Our programmers pay extra attention to security when developing our plugins. *The User Plugin* is a professional quality plugin, that is not only easy to use and set, but is also secured against most malicious attacks.
All our plugins use a standardized administration interface, called *LWS Admin Panel*. This interface has been designed for you. It is easy to use and navigate. All features are explained as you progress through the settings.
We provide a full documentation for our plugins, accessible directly through the Admin Interface. You're never lost and you quickly find the option or feature you're looking for.
Please see our online documentation at [Long Watch Plugins - Documentation Centre](https://plugins.longwatchstudio.com/en/documentation-en/)
